Also CPU activity keeps at low rate. Â On Mac OS X it is possible to track Unity's background activity when it is reading files using following command:

`sudo fs_usage | grep Unity | grep /`

This command shows which files are being opened by Unity at the time. This should give you enough information on its current activity and make a rough estimation of process complete time.
