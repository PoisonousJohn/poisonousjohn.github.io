<p class="about-name">Ivan Fateev</p>
<!-- <p class="about-position">Head of Mobile Development<br/>@<a href="https://anna.money">ANNA</a></p> -->

Hello! My name is Ivan Fateev. I'm a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience.

I'm passionate about doing my job. I like making people's job easier by organizing processes, communication and culture.

I believe that soft skills are no less important than professional ones. And they help me solve much more problems than I would solve just with technical approach.

During my career I had opportunity to work in different areas which include:

- Web site development
- iOS development
- Android development
- Game development
- Backend development
- FinTech.

I believe you can say that I'm generalist. But it doesn't mean I don't have proficiency in skills. I'm specialist but in several areas.

Thus my skill set is pretty wide. You can find my self assessment list below.

Some of the skills I didn't use quite a while, but I assessed them at the peak, since I can get them up to date quickly.

## If you want to reach me out

My preferred way of communication on professional matters is LinkedIn or email. For personal questions I prefer Telegram.
